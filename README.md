# CloudDesktop
Software handler to make enable seemless network computing acceleration for any application or game

Seemlesly code, video edit, game, type, design and much more on the puniest laptop with remote execution of aplications. Set up a server running as host, set up a client laptop, and then use the server as a remote workstation as if all there hardware was crammed in the laptop.

Currently, everything is work in progress, and will just hopefully be available later

# Will support:
* Openning any local folder from the server perspective as a network drive
* Utilizing remote desktop, install aplication on server while having a executable shortcut client-side as-if the application was installed locally
* Utilizing, Parsec, play any game on local device as if all the servers computing power was there locally

# Note:
* Does require a server to interface with, that has all one's hardware needs
* Does require a fine, but not incredible, internet connection, with relatively low latency
* SW has been tested between two devices 300km seperated with server network specs: XMb/s down, XMb/s up and client network specs: XMb/s down, XMb/s up with Xms response on ping (experience will of course vary)
